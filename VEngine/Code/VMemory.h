//TODO: need to come back here and make a custom allocator to be able to track mem usage and display
//it in debug menus. Not sure how to go about logging the size of buffers belonging to third party libs
//like d3d11 or xaudio2, but I'm sure there's a way.

//namespace VMemory
//{
// void alloc();
//}
