Todo List for engine:

-C++ RTTI
-Engine-wide Undo/Redo 
-Experimental live gameplay editing
-Lights
-Shadows
-Actor component systems (Keep actor tick(), use a map and index those with actor UID or something. If using the array approach, think about using GC for cleanup and just use raw pointers.)
-Shader system update (Look into uber shaders)
-Audio (XAudio2 or DXToolkit?)
-Actor parenting
-Prefabs
-C++ hot reloading
-Skeletal animation
